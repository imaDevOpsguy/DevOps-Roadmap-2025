## ðŸ“… Month 3 â€“ CI/CD + Docker
**Goal:** Automate builds and deployments.

### ðŸ“Œ Topics
- Jenkins: installation, pipelines (Freestyle & Declarative)
- GitHub Actions: workflow YAML, triggers
- Docker: images, containers, Dockerfile, volumes, networks

### ðŸ›  Practice Tasks
- [ ] Dockerize a Node.js or Python app
- [ ] Create Jenkins pipeline to build & run Docker image
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds

### âœ… Milestones
- [ ] Dockerized app committed  
- [ ] Jenkins pipeline configured  
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow working

## ðŸ“… Month 4 â€“ Kubernetes + IaC
**Goal:** Deploy applications at scale with Kubernetes & Terraform.

### ðŸ“Œ Topics
- Kubernetes: pods, deployments, services, ingress, ConfigMaps, secrets
- Helm: chart basics
- Terraform: providers, resources, variables

### ðŸ›  Practice Tasks
- [ ] Deploy app to Kubernetes (Minikube/k3s)
- [ ] Use Helm chart for deployment
- [ ] Create Terraform script to deploy EC2 & S3

### âœ… Milestones
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment working  
- [ ] Helm chart committed  
- [ ] Terraform AWS infra created

## ðŸ“… Month 5 â€“ Monitoring + Security
**Goal:** Add observability and security scanning.

### ðŸ“Œ Topics
- Monitoring: Prometheus & Grafana
- Logging: ELK stack or Loki
- Security: Trivy image scanning, SonarQube code analysis

### ðŸ›  Practice Tasks
- [ ] Install Prometheus + Grafana for Kubernetes
- [ ] Create dashboard to monitor CPU/memory
- [ ] Integrate Trivy in CI/CD pipeline

### âœ… Milestones
- [ ] Grafana dashboard live  
- [ ] Image scans in CI/CD logs  
- [ ] Logging configured

## ðŸ“… Month 6 â€“ End-to-End Project
**Goal:** Combine all skills into one portfolio project.

### ðŸ“Œ Project
**Deploy a Full-Stack Application on AWS with:**
- GitHub Actions/Jenkins CI/CD
- Docker & Kubernetes
- Terraform provisioning
- Helm deployment
- Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
- Trivy security scans

### ðŸ›  Steps
1. Store code in GitHub
2. Build Docker image via CI/CD
3. Provision AWS EKS via Terraform
4. Deploy app via Helm
5. Monitor with Prometheus & Grafana
6. Scan images with Trivy

### âœ… Milestones
